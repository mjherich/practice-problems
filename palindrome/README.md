# Palindrome Problems

There are several palindrome problems here which range in difficulty.

## Palindrome Check

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether or not the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as a string that is written the same forward and backward.

`Sample input: "abcdcba"`

`Sample output: True (it is a palindrome)`
