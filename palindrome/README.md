# Palindrome Problems

There are several palindrome problems here which range in difficulty.

## Palindrome Check

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether or not the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as a string that is written the same forward and backward.

`Sample input: "abcdcba"`

`Sample output: True (it is a palindrome)`

## Longest Palindromic Substring

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring. A palindrome is defined as a string that is written the same forward and backward. Assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.

`Sample input: "abaxyzzyxf"`

`Sample output: "xyzzyx"`
